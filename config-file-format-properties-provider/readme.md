# Properties Configuration File Format Provider

File format provider for properties files.

This provider installs support for both traditional properties (`*.properties`) and XML properties (`*.properties.xml`) file formats. Unlike the original Java properties format, this implementation defaults to UTF-8 encoding unless a Byte Order Mark (BOM) is present.
