# Confound Demo

Demonstration of using Confound.

The application manually sets up a configuration to be loaded from the local resources and then from `~/.confound-demo/config.*`,  based upon the supported file formats. Configuration parameters can be overridden with environment variables or by system properties.

The application also demonstrates how to compartmentalize a separate configuration to a specific area of the application.

The application will print the value of the `foo` configuration parameter.
