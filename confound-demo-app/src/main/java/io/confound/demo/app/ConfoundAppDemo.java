/**
 * Demonstration of using Confound in an application.
 * <p>
 * This application demonstrates using a single <code>confound-app-provider</code> dependency to automatically discover an application data directory in
 * <code>app.data.dir</code>, indicated as a system property or as an environment variable. The directory can be absolute or relative to the user home
 * directory. The configuration file will be discovered in that directory with the base filename <code>config</code> and an extension based upon the file format
 * providers installed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default properties files and XML properties files are supported.
